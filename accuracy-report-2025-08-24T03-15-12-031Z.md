**Test Date**: 2025-08-24T03:15:12.031Z

## EXPRESS Framework Results

- **Projects Tested**: 1
- **Overall Accuracy**: 25%

### Pattern Detection Results:
- **initialize**: 100% ✅ Excellent
- **authenticate**: 0% ❌ Poor
- **strategy**: 0% ❌ Poor
- **routeProtection**: 0% ❌ Poor

### Issues Identified:
